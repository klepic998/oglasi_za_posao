This project is about Job advertisements. It is developed to make it easier for people to hear about some job offer. In the project, there are 3 kinds of people - guest, administrator and registered user. Admin can see everything about posts, comments, list of users. He can see all posts, how many comments each post have and the author of the post. User can access to his profile and change the information or delete his profile. Guest can see all the posts and add comments, but he has to write some nickname. User can choose if he wants to get notifications when someone add comment on his post. During the registration, user will get the confirmation email. If he doesn't confirm his registration, he can't access the application as a registered user. There are also different categories for jobs, admin can change them, delete them or add new one.
